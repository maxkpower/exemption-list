# BITWARDEN PHISHING DETECTION EXEMPTIONS LIST
# ============================================================================
#
# This file contains domains that should be excluded from phishing detection.
# Domains in this list will override the phishing database and never be 
# flagged as phishing sites.
#
# ============================================================================
# FORMAT & SYNTAX
# ============================================================================
#
# • One domain per line
# • Lines starting with # are comments (ignored)
# • Empty lines are ignored
# • URLs with protocols (https://) are automatically cleaned
# • Paths and query strings are automatically stripped
#
# ============================================================================
# MATCHING RULES
# ============================================================================
#
# EXACT MATCH (no prefix):
#   example.com
#   → Matches ONLY: example.com
#   → Does NOT match: www.example.com, app.example.com
#
# SUBDOMAIN WILDCARD (. prefix):
#   .example.com
#   → Matches: example.com (base domain)
#   → Matches: app.example.com (subdomain)
#   → Matches: www.example.com (subdomain)
#   → Matches: account.example.com (subdomain)
#   → Matches: deep.nested.example.com (nested subdomain)
#   → Does NOT match: example.net (different TLD)
#   → Does NOT match: fakeexample.com (different domain)
#
# ============================================================================
# EXAMPLES & USE CASES
# ============================================================================
#
# Use Case 1: Organization with multiple subdomains
#   Problem: Users access app.company.com, account.company.com, admin.company.com
#   Solution: Add .company.com (one entry covers all)
#
# Use Case 2: Single specific subdomain only
#   Problem: Only portal.example.com should be exempted
#   Solution: Add portal.example.com (exact match)
#
# Use Case 3: URL shortener (no subdomains)
#   Problem: bit.ly is flagged but is legitimate
#   Solution: Add bit.ly (exact match, no wildcard needed)
#
# ============================================================================
# BEST PRACTICES
# ============================================================================
#
# ✅ DO:
#   • Use wildcard (.) for organizations with multiple subdomains
#   • Document WHY a domain is exempted (add comment above entry)
#   • Group related domains together with section headers
#   • Regularly review and remove outdated entries
#   • Test changes in development before deploying
#
# ❌ DON'T:
#   • Don't exempt entire TLDs (e.g., .com is too broad and won't work)
#   • Don't add domains without understanding why they're flagged
#   • Don't use wildcards for single-subdomain use cases
#   • Don't include protocols (https://) - they're auto-removed but avoid confusion
#
# ============================================================================
# SECURITY WARNING
# ============================================================================
#
# ⚠️  Adding a domain to this list disables phishing protection for it!
# ⚠️  Only add domains you trust completely
# ⚠️  Verify domain ownership before adding
